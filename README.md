Repository containing work from DS3000 - Foundations of Data Science

**1. Health Indicators and Diabetes Analysis**  
*Files:* `diabetes_012_health_indicators_BRFSS2015.csv`  
This project likely involves analyzing health indicators from the BRFSS (Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System) dataset to identify patterns or correlations with diabetes prevalence. It may include data exploration, statistical analysis, or predictive modeling to understand health risk factors associated with diabetes.

**2. San Francisco Airport Passenger Statistics Analysis**  
*Files:* `Air_Traffic_Passenger_Statistics.csv`, `DataSF_Data_Dictionary_for_Air_Traffic_Passenger_Statistics.pdf`  
This project appears to focus on analyzing air traffic passenger statistics from San Francisco International Airport. Using the data dictionary and the passenger statistics file, this project might explore trends in passenger volume, airline usage, or seasonal patterns in air travel.

**3. Weekly Assignments in Data Science/Analytics**  
*Files:* `DS3000.W1.Janav.Sama.ipynb`, `DS3000.W2.Janav.Sama.ipynb`, `DS3000.W4.Janav.Sama.ipynb`, `DS3000.W5.Janav.Sama.ipynb`  
These weekly assignments likely consist of a series of data science exercises or projects that cover various topics. Each notebook may contain specific tasks such as data manipulation, visualization, statistical analysis, or machine learning related to weekly course material.

**4. Baby Names Data Analysis**  
*Files:* `babies.csv`  
This file might be used for a separate project on baby names, potentially analyzing trends in naming patterns over time or exploring demographic data. If not part of an assignment, this could be a standalone project focusing on name popularity or cultural shifts.
